        # The Idea

        This research project focuses on improving flood prediction in the Alps by analyzing compound climate events like rain-on-snow flooding. It aims to integrate statistical and machine learning methods to create a robust model that can predict flood scenarios and their probabilities. This model aims to support disaster preparedness and contribute to climate resilience by utilizing satellite data to explore new combinations of flood hazards and their impacts. 
        
        This project integrates:
        
        - **Statistical modelling and machine learning**
        - **Scientific computation**
        - **Climate change modelling**
        - **Physical knowledge of rain-on-snow flooding**
        
        # The Benefits
        
        The modelling framework:
        
        - **Predicts from unusual or unseen combinations of events**, like rain-on-snow. This is achieved through statistical advances to predict the compounding effect of events leading to flooding.
        
        - **Estimates hazard frequency more effectively** (e.g., the 100-year flood), emerging as a result of the model being informed of the events leading to the flooding. This results in more informed infrastructure design and better risk-informed decision making.
        
        - **Explains the reason behind flooding** by answering questions like: What paths in the event tree are most likely to lead to a 100-year flood? What is the probability of a 200-year flood, given a large snowpack this winter? This allows stakeholders to explore critical 'what-if' scenarios, making informed decisions in emergency response planning and resource management.
        
        - **Provides a clearer picture of flooding under climate change** from the improved understanding of events leading up to flooding.
